				<p>I've liked computers ever since I was just a tiny kid. I would help all the teachers with their computers and also cause chaos after quickly learning about computer stuff and the flaws within the school computers. I also put Windows 10 on a school desktop back when it was brand new. Funnily enough, when they upgraded the computers to Windows 10 eventually, that desktop went back to being the only Windows 7 desktop.</p>

				<p>I love poutine and a very specific Subway sandwich. I also love flaked tuna cans, I don't know why they're so good. On the contrary, I do heavily dislike meat in general.</p>
